# Portfolio Website
----

### Abstract:
This site was created during the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. I graduated from the program on August 23rd, 2015 and have since updated the portfolio to reflect my current projects.

This portfolio was created strictly through the use of HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. A Photoshop Mockup was provided from which I built the requested design, then modified to my own taste.

__Note about the center banner image:__
  * _The image was taken from http://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Visualizations/InternetMap and Chris Harrison has be attributed in the bottom right of the image where his homepage link still resides. The image is an internet connection density map of the world._
  * _Unfortunately, I am still working on cross-browser issues in order to display the best version of the image based on device since the picture tag does not work in every browser._
