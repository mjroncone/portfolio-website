# portfolio-website
A portfolio website created for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.

I started the Udacity nanodegree program on Sunday June 7th, 2015. 

This repository contains the first actual project of the program, which is a personal portfolio which will contain
the projects that I will be creating throughout the program.

First submission of this project in particular happened Sunday June 14th, 2015. Seven days afer beginning.
